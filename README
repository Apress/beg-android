Welcome to the source code for _The Busy Coder's Guide to Android
Development_!

The names of the top-level directories roughly correspond to a
shortened form of the chapter titles. Since chapter numbers
change with every release, and since some samples are used by
multiple chapters, I am loathe to put chapter numbers in the
actual directory names.

Here is a lineup of chapters with sample projects and their
corresponding directory names, in chapter order:

Skeleton 		Creating a Skeleton Application
Layouts			Using XML-Based Layouts
Basic			Employing Basic Widgets
Containers		Working with Containers
Selection		Using Selection Widgets
FancyLists		Getting Fancy with Lists
Fancy			Employing Fancy Widgets and Containers
Menus			Applying Menus
Fonts			Fonts
WebKit			Embedding the WebKit Browser
Messages		Showing Pop-Up Messages
Threads			Dealing with Threads
Prefs			Using Preferences
Files			Accessing Files
Resources		Working with Resources
Rotation		Handling Rotation
Java			Leveraging Java Libraries
Internet		Communicating via the Internet
Activities		Launching Activities and Sub-Activities
Introspection		Finding Available Actions via Introspection
Notifications		Alerting Users Via Notifications
Maps			Mapping with MapView and MapActivity
Phone			Handling Telephone Calls
Search			Searching with SearchManager

In addition, the "Managing and Accessing Local Databases" and
the two chapters on content providers ("Using a Content Provider"
and "Building a Content Provider") use the ContentProvider
directory of samples.

Also, "Creating a Service" and "Invoking a Service" share the
Service directory of samples.

These projects work with Android 1.1. Many also work with Android
1.5. However, Android 1.5 was released too late in the editorial
process of the book to update all the examples and chapters. As a
result, the projects in this archive are all set up for Android 1.1,
to match the book's main chapters. You can use the "android update
project" command to convert the projects to Android 1.5 (or newer)
to try them on that version of Android.
